#### The problem
Healthcare professionals need to stay up-to-date with both their specialities and general medicine, but most educational material is boring and unengaging. This directly affects the quality of the treatment they deliver!

#### The solution
Community led site where health care providers can upload video, image and text cases and test themselves with existing contributions. The use of points is a gamification mechanism to encourage engagement and introduce a light-hearted competitive element. 
Realtime aspects are particularly useful for live events (eg. conferences), increasing interest and ensuring that information is retained for the future.

#### The stack
- Firebase backend
- React JS frontend
