## Continuing Medical Education Community

Demo is at brecon.firebaseapp.com
Source is at github.com/bs1180/hackathon

#### The problem
Medical professionals need to stay up-to-date with both their specialities and general medicine, but most educational material for them is boring.

#### The solution
Community led site, where health care providers can upload video, image and text cases, and earn points. The use of points is a gamification mechanism intended to encourage engagement and introduce a light-hearted competitive element.
Realtime aspects are particularly useful for live events (eg. conferences)

#### The stack
Firebase backend
React JS frontend
